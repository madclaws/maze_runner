# Maze Runner

> Mazes, Mazes everywhere

## Running

```
cargo run <atomic number of maze name>

Ex: `cargo run 3` will render lithium maze
```


## Lithium

> Random perfect maze with sidwinder algorithm, rendered with [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/) 

![lithium](mazes/lithium.png?raw=true  "lithium")

## Helium

> Random perfect maze with sidewinder algorithm. Northern open bias is visible
